# ðŸ“Œ IoTPrune - smartapp dataset compatible with SmartThings

## Overview  
This repository includes a collection of SmartThings-compatible Node.js applications, consisting of benign apps and malicious apps covering major [Vulnerability Types](#vulnerability-types), including both handcrafted examples from <a href="https://github.com/IoTBench/IoTBench-test-suite/tree/master/smartThings/smartThings-Soteria" target="_blank">IoTBench</a> and <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~yaafer/teaching/papers/ndss2019_07A-1_Celik_paper.pdf" target="_blank">IoTGuard</a> and third-party apps from the SmartThings community [Smartthings community](https://community.smartthings.com/) . It serves as a valuable resource for research studies, enabling comparisons with state-of-the-art solutions.

### Folder Details  
- **`Malicious/`** â†’ Contains **intentionally designed** SmartThings apps that exhibit different types of vulnerabilities.  
- **`ThirdParty/`** â†’ Contains **SmartThings community applications** that may or may not have security issues.

## Vulnerability Types
This repository examines different types of security issues, including:  

- **Logic Injection** â€“ Executing unintended code dynamically.  
- **Missing Subscription** â€“ Apps missing subscriptions to necessary events, leading to non-response or unhandled events.  
- **Missing Command** â€“ Apps failing to issue necessary commands to devices, leaving them in an incorrect state.  
- **Malicious (Scheduled) Command** â€“ Apps scheduling malicious or unintended commands for execution at a later time.  
- **Conflicting Commands (One App)** â€“ Apps issuing conflicting commands to a device.  
- **Endless Loop Commands** â€“ Apps issuing commands that cause a device or system to enter a perpetual loop.  
- **Race Conditions** â€“ Apps that change device state in conflicting way.
- **Data Leak** â€“ Leaking data about the state of the house or devices (e.g., occupancy, device status).
  
## Details
The detailed explanation of the malicious points within the SmartApps is provided in [Soteria](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08876) (Table 3 and Table 4) and <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~yaafer/teaching/papers/ndss2019_07A-1_Celik_paper.pdf" target="_blank">IoTGuard</a> (Table IV). Researchers can compare their results with these references for further insights. Additionally, we have organized and provided comprehensive information about these vulnerabilities in the malicious apps, including the type of vulnerabilities and a more detailed description, which can be found here.


| Apps  | Vulnerability Types  | Description  |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| ID1BrightenMyPath     | Conflicting commands  | Set the switch to conflicting states.  |
| ID2SecuritySystem     | Malicious Command  | Disable security when the user is away.  |
| ID3SmokeAlarm     | Malicious (Scheduled) Command  | Simulate a scheduled alarm command.  |
| ID3TurnItOnOffandOnEvery30Secs     | Malicious loop  | Continuously toggle the device switch state. |
| ID4PowerAllowance     | Conflicting commands | Set the switch to conflicting on and off states.  |
| ID5DynamicMethodInvocationAlarm     | Logic Injection  | Deactivate the alarm in the presence of smoke.  |
| ID6TurnOnSwitchNotHome     | Malicious Command  | Activate the switch when the user is not home. |
| ID7ConflictTimeandPresenceSensor     | Race condition  | Update the device state based on time and presence sensor to different states. |
| ID8LocationSubscribeFailure     | Missing Subscription  | Fail to subscribe to location state changes.  |
| ID11sensitiveDataLeak    | Data Leak | Transmit switch state data to a malicious server. |
| ID12RemoteCommand    | Logic injection | Schedule a remote command to trigger the alarm siren. |
| ID13RunTimeLogicRequired    | Call by reflection | Dynamically activate the switch. |
| TP2    | Malicious Command | The switch turns on and blinks lights when no user is detected. |
| MS21 , MS9    | Race condition | Modify the switch state to different states due to motion detection. |
| Group 1    | Malicious Command | Lock the door in response to smoke detection. |
| Group 2    | Race condition | update the light state on and off states by different handlers. |
| Group 3    | Malicious Command | Disable the security system. |



## How to Use the Repository  
### ðŸ”§ Setup Instructions  
1. **Clone the repository:**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name.git
   cd repository-name
2. **Install libraries**
   
   The applications are built with Node.js for SmartThings. Ensure you have Node.js installed.

3. **Running the Applications**
Each application runs on a different port on localhost. If needed, update the port in the respective script files before running.
To start an application, use:
    ```bash
    node <app_filename>.js
    node Malicious/ID3SmokeAlarm #example

4. **Result validation**
After using the repository to validate your tool and assess its effectiveness in detecting malicious points, you can refer to the ground truth provided in [Details](#details). Locate the app by its name, and you will find detailed information about the vulnerabilities in the subsequent columns.
   
##  Disclaimer  
This repository is for **research and educational purposes only**. The malicious apps included here are **intentionally designed** to demonstrate security weaknesses in SmartThings applications.  
Do not deploy these apps on real devices or production environments.
