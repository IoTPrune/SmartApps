# ðŸ“Œ IoTPrune - smartapp dataset compatible with Smartthings

## Overview  
This repository includes a collection of SmartThings-compatible Node.js applications, consisting of benign apps and malicious apps covering major vulnarability types, including both handcrafted examples and third-party apps from the SmartThings community. It serves as a valuable resource for research studies, enabling comparisons with state-of-the-art solutions.

### Folder Details  
- **`Malicious/`** â†’ Contains **intentionally designed** SmartThings apps that exhibit different types of vulnerabilities.  
- **`ThirdParty/`** â†’ Contains **SmartThings community applications** that may or may not have security issues.

## Vulnerability Types
This repository examines different types of security issues, including:  

- **Logic Injection** â€“ Executing unintended code dynamically.  
- **Missing Subscription** â€“ Apps missing subscriptions to necessary events, leading to non-response or unhandled events.  
- **Missing Command** â€“ Apps failing to issue necessary commands to devices, leaving them in an incorrect state.  
- **Malicious (Scheduled) Command** â€“ Apps scheduling malicious or unintended commands for execution at a later time.  
- **Conflicting Commands (One App)** â€“ Apps issuing conflicting commands to a device.  
- **Endless Loop Commands** â€“ Apps issuing commands that cause a device or system to enter a perpetual loop.  
- **Race Conditions** â€“ Apps that change device state in conflicting way.
- **Data Leak** â€“ Leaking data about the state of the house or devices (e.g., occupancy, device status).
  
## Details


| Apps  | Type of Vulnerabilities  | Description  |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| ID1BrightenMyPath     | Conflicting commands  | Set the switch to conflicting states.  |
| ID2SecuritySystem     | Malicious Command  | Disable security when the user is away.  |
| ID3SmokeAlarm     | Malicious (Scheduled) Command  | Simulate a scheduled alarm command.  |
| ID3TurnItOnOffandOnEvery30Secs     | Malicious loop  | Continuously toggle the device switch state. |
| ID4PowerAllowance     | Conflicting commands | Set the switch to conflicting on and off states.  |
| ID5DynamicMethodInvocationAlarm     | Logic Injection  | Deactivate the alarm in the presence of smoke.  |
| ID6TurnOnSwitchNotHome     | Malicious Command  | Activate the switch when the user is not home. |
| ID7ConflictTimeandPresenceSensor     | Race condition  | Update the device state based on time and presence sensor to different states. |
| ID8LocationSubscribeFailure     | Missing Subscription  | Fail to subscribe to location state changes.  |
| ID11sensitiveDataLeak    | Data Leak | Transmit switch state data to a malicious server. |
| ID12RemoteCommand    | Logic injection | Schedule a remote command to trigger the alarm siren. |
| ID13RunTimeLogicRequired    | Call by reflection | Dynamically activate the switch. |
| TP2    | Malicious Command | The switch turns on and blinks lights when no user is detected. |
| MS21 , MS9    | Race condition | Modify the switch state to different states due to motion detection. |
| Group 1    | Malicious Command | Lock the door in response to smoke detection. |
| Group 2    | Race condition | update the light state on and off states by different handlers. |
| Group 3    | Malicious Command | Disable the security system. |



## How to Use the Repository  
### ðŸ”§ Setup Instructions  
1. **Clone the repository:**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name.git
   cd repository-name
2. **Install libraries**
   
   The applications are built with Node.js for SmartThings. Ensure you have Node.js installed.

3. **Running the Applications**
Each application runs on a different port on localhost. If needed, update the port in the respective script files before running.
To start an application, use:
    ```bash
    node <app_filename>.js
    node Malicious/ID3SmokeAlarm #example
     
##  Disclaimer  
This repository is for **research and educational purposes only**. The malicious apps included here are **intentionally designed** to demonstrate security weaknesses in SmartThings applications.  
Do not deploy these apps on real devices or production environments.
